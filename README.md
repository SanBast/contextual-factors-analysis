# TheUniversityOfSheffield
Code for the internship @The University of Sheffield.

## How-to:
1) Run 'data_generation.py' which exploits 'data_generator.py' to generate data starting from the indicated subject folder. It relies on "fist_test.ipynb" in the _notebooks_ folder
2) Run 'main.py' which exploits 'weather_analysis.py' to run a weather analysis on cadence etc, generating a statistics file in the _output path_ indicated as argument in the command line.

## Where-to:
* _notebooks_ contains the experimental notebooks that visually represent the pipeline to generate the files, step by step
* _.py files_ are the files designated to work in a command-line fashion from your terminal.
